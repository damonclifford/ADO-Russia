# Automated reports on recent economic developments

This repo contains the Python script that automates the production of an economic report analyzing recent economic developments for Russia and ADB DMCs.

## Instructions

1. To generate the quick report for Russia, simply run the script in your IDE.
2. To generate a quick report for any DMC, simply change the 'country' parameter in the top part of the code using the DMC's 3-letter ADB code (e.g. ARM for Armenia).
